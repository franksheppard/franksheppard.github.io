**Abstract**

FRSH CLI is a SaaS platform to automate creation and allocation of resources for new projects.

**Intoduction**

I've been looking to make my life easyer when I'm starting a new project, when it comes to setting up all the basic services I need to manage and develop the project, like:

- Creating a Github repository with a default folder structure
- Making a Google drive folder with some of my default documents eg. a Project Plan, Ballance Sheet etc
- An Asana board always comes in handy

So, I've been working on an eventually a SaaS solution to manage all the projects resource allocation.

You interact with the service via a CLI client but you have access to a dashboard as well.

It creates my local environment and allocates the 3rd party resources I might need eg. Github repository, Asana project board, Google drive folder with project documents filled in enough to get me started.
