This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

In this post, I want to share the basics of generating Python code documentation using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html).


Installing Sphinx
Setup your Project
Basic Sphinx Configuration
  Configure the Location of your Python Package
  Add autodoc extension
Add automodule to  index.rst
Document your code with Docstrings
Generate your HTML
