subtitle: Let me introduce myself
---

I am an engineer with a wide area of interests, expertise and experience in various industries.

My story starts in Bucharest the capital city of Romania, then in 2016 I and moved to the UK.
My love of technology starts with video games, of which unfortunately I haven't got a chance to develop yet.

Data science and artificial intelligence is my current hill to conquer.

Personally I develop various software projects which at some point I would want to migrate to a product form or just work on them for learning and fun, from process automation to product and design, from machine learning and artificial intelligence projects to SaaS solutions.

### My story
