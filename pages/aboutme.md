I am an engineer with a wide area of interests, expertise and experience in various industries.

My story starts in Bucharest the capital city of Romania, when I and moved to the UK. 
My love of technology starts with video games, of which unfortunately I haven't got a chance to develop yet.

With data science and artificial intelligence in my focus I tame various design and software projects varying from process automation to product and design, from machine learning and artificial intelligence projects to SaaS solutions

### My story
